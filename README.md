# Description
Please find a short description of how I tackled each question.

## Questions 1 and 2
I used the same template for these two questions as the only difference between the two was the url call to the api. I used axios in the backend to call the api, and returned the result to the frontend.

## Question 3
I used the Effect hook in order to fetch all the countries on loading the page. I also used the State hook to filter through the countries and update the filtered countries while the user is inserting the data.

## Question 4
For this question, I created a feature branch to run and test the application and make sure that it's working fine before pushing it to the development branch. I also used redux to save the state of the total amount of coins after each spin.
